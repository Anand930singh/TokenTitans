# Music Rights and Royalty Management Platform

## Overview
This platform addresses key issues in the music industry by solving inefficiencies in rights management, lack of transparency in royalty distribution, and frequent disputes over ownership and payments. It replaces manual, error-prone processes with automated, accurate systems. Data privacy is enhanced through secure identity verification and privacy-preserving computations. The platform also tackles fragmented systems and cross-border transaction complexities, benefiting independent artists with accessible, efficient, and transparent management tools.

By integrating MusicX, Polygon, and Anon Aadhar, this platform creates a comprehensive solution for efficient, secure, and transparent music rights and royalty management.
